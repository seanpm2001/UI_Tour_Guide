# UI_Tour_Guide
Give users a tour of your UI so you don't have to explain as much.

## About

UI Tour Guide is an assistant agent tool that can be simply configured to explain common parts of the user interface of your system, in a way that is accessible to new computer users, or people confused with your interface.

Each individual element and object should be easily explainable to any computer user, and 5 default configuration templates for setting up these explanations are available.

The project is written in Python, for good software support, and easy source code readability. It is also a language I am familiar with, and one I know works well. I feel C or Rust would be a bit too complicated here.
